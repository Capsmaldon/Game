# Game

Coded in C++ using the SDL2 Development Library

Made in my spare time over summer 2018 ~~to completely dwarf and be better than hotline miami~~ to improve my knowledge of C++ and get better at creating bigger programs. No game engine was used, SDL only allows you to print images to the screen. So collisions, positions, camera and tile placements were all done by me.

Much was learnt but this project is as readable as a bag of scrabble tiles.

Some features include:\
*Automatic detection of 'fog' when new tiles are placed\
*Camera fixed to player\
*Tiles renderered are only the ones on screen (and a little bit)\
*Collisions work as you would expect them to (Harder than I'd first thought)\
*Animations for the player

Let's not talk about the shooting
